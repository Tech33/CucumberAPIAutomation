      | I do a lot of research and discuss it with my physician. I trust them to provide valuable input in to my decision.                                                                         |
      | Traditional healthcare is one part of my overall health perspective. I use traditional, complementary, eastern, chiropractic and other areas of medicine to maintain my optimum health.    |
      | A family member usually encourages me to go to the doctor and helps me make decisions about my health. I want my healthcare to be convenient and efficient.                                |
      | I use the healthcare system frequently, and I am frustrated by it. I wish there were more convenient and efficient options for me and my family. The system doesnâ€™t work very well for me. |
      | I trust my physician, they are well trained and so I listen and do what they say.                                                                                                          |

      | httpMethod | endpoint                       | id | responseCode | JsonSchema                 |
